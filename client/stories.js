I was excited to go ${answers.activity} together because there is something about ${answers.activity} that really helps me see who a person really is deep down. We had a decent time and we're starving afterwards so we went to get some ${answers.food}. The food was great! After grabbing a bite we went for a walk through the park nearby and saw several ${answers.animal} playing. It was really adorable. It made me feel inspired, so I started ${answers.action}. I was feeling pretty confident about myself during the date because I was wearing my lucky ${answers.color} ${answers.clothing}. It always makes me feel more confident. Especially while I'm ${answers.methodOfTravel} through the city. All in all, things were going pretty well. We had been hanging out for a while but I still didn't feel like I really knew ${match.name}. We headed towards the ${answers.place} ${answers.action} together as we travelled. We got thirsty along the way and ducked into ${answers.restaurant} and got ${answers.beverage}s. I don't know if it was the ${answers.action} together or the ${answers.beverage}s but we talked for what seemed like forever after that. We were at ${answers.restaurant} for so long we started getting hungry again and got some ${answers.dessert}.  This turned out to be a pretty nice date after all.

I left my house a little early because it can take a while to get to our rendezvous point around noon, especially while ${answers.methodOfTravel}. I was excited because we had decided to meet up at ${answers.restaurant} for ${answers.food} and ${answers.beverage}, a favorite of mine. However, within a few minutes I expected this date to go nowhere.  ${match.name} looked great in their ${answers.color} ${answers.clothing} but looks was about as far as the greatness lasted. ${genderPronoun} constantly interrupted me while speaking and ${wasWere} rude to the staff at ${answers.restaurant}. Rudeness to wait staff is one thing I can not abide by, their jobs are hard enough as it is. I brought up my love of ${answers.animal} hoping that that could move the conversation in a lighter direction, but to no avail. ${match.name} would not let me hear the end of it on how much ${genderPronoun} hated ${answers.animal}. I couldn’t have been more annoyed or less interested. I really wanted to leave and go ${answers.action} by myself. ${match.name} kept going on and on and on about themselves. It had only been an hour but it felt like I’d been sitting in ${answers.restaurant} all day. After paying for my meal I told ${match.name} that we were very different people and that I was not interested in going to the ${answers.venue} to finish the date. I quickly left and decided I had earned a treat. I stopped by my favorite ${answers.dessert} place and got the biggest ${answers.dessert} I could and enjoyed that while ${answers.activity} by myself.`);

I do hope this outfit will work for ${answers.activity}, we'll see. I started ${answers.methodOfTravel} to the ${answers.place} to meet ${match.name}. When I arrived ${genderPronoun} ${wasWere} already there wearing this outlandish shirt covered in ${answers.animal}. I both hated and loved it. What direction is this date going to head in I thought to myself. We had an enjoyable time ${answers.activity}. After which we were both famished and decided to head to ${answers.restaurant} for ${answers.beverage} and ${answers.food}. We both scarfed down our food, impressing each other and ourselves with how unembarrassed we were about doing so. ${match.name} suggested maybe we continue the date and try ${answers.action} at the ${answers.venue}. I agreed but as we got up to leave I knocked my ${answers.beverage} over and it spilled all over my ${answers.clothing}. I said I needed to stop by my place to get a different ${answers.clothing}. ${genderPronoun} ${wasWere} up for the adventure, so we left for my place. We did a lot of talking and laughing on the way.

If we had only met at the ${answers.venue} we wouldn’t have had to deal with that. Not that having met at the ${answers.venue} would have made the date itself any better or worse. When ${genderPronoun} arrived we had a laugh about the unfortunate beginning of the date. We quickly decided to start ${answers.activity} which really worked up our appetites. ${genderPronoun} really wanted ${answers.food} and that sounded great to me so we went to ${answers.restaurant} to get ${answers.food} and ${answers.beverage}. We decided to also get some ${answers.dessert} to go because maybe we'd want that on the walk later. Feeling satiated with full bellies we walked around talking. The sun was going down which cast a beautiful ${answers.color} glow on everything. It was quite magical. And paired wonderfully with the ${answers.dessert}.  I had a great night. ${match.name} and I decided to meet up again soon and we parted ways with a kiss.`);

While walking through the cemetery I saw 3 ${answers.animal} which I read as a good omen, probably due to me wearing my lucky ${answers.clothing}. I met ${match.name} in front of a mausoleum in the NE corner of the cemetery. I think to myself, ${genderPronoun} sure ${toBe} brave to meet me here at this hour, let's see if ${genderPronoun} ${toHave} what it takes to keep up with me. We sat around the cemetery for a while talking and drinking some ${answers.beverage} I brought with me. After a while I suggested ${answers.activity}, which is met with enthusiasm by my new partner in crime. We headed off, plotting and laughing maniacally as we traveled to the ${answers.place}. We spent several hours ${answers.activity} and worked up quite the appetite. Fortunately, by the time we decided we were done, places started opening for breakfast. We headed off to ${answers.restaurant} for ${answers.food} where we spilled our guts to one another about our lives, hopes, and dreams. After spending these hours together we decided to meet up next Saturday night for ${answers.action} during the full moon at the ${answers.venue}.
